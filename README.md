# Vanced Mirror

Since Vanced has been discontinued, it has become increasingly difficult to find the correct APKs, so here is a complete mirror of the Vanced API.

## How to use

### My Vanced Manager Fork

You can use my Vanced Manager build where this mirror is the default, and was compiled with the latest commits from the dev branch of Vanced Manager.

* [VancedManager](https://github.com/HitaloSama/VancedManager)

### Official Vanced Manager

You can also follow these steps to use this mirror in the official Vanced Manager build.

1. Open Vanced Manager and the three dots menu then go to `About`
2. Press the empty space for atleast 10 times
3. It will say that you unlocked developer mode
4. Go to settings and press the new settings icon on the top right
5. Now change the `Channel URL` to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HitaloSama/VancedMirror/main/api/v1`

### Split APKs Installer

You can also opt for some split APKs installer like [SAI](https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI).

1. Go to [Beta](https://github.com/HitaloSama/VancedMirror/tree/main/api%2Fbeta) if you want beta versions or [v1](https://github.com/HitaloSama/VancedMirror/tree/main/api%2Fv1)  if you want the stable(or aka v1 versions)
2. Choose which version you want to install
3. Go to `{beta or v1}/apks/{version}/{variant}/`
4. Now open the Arch folder and choose your artitecture (if you have a phone, you are most possibly an arm64, if you are using any android fork for pc(ie android x86) then you chooce x86
5. Go back 
6. Choose Language and grab as many languages as you want 
7. And finally go to theme and get **only 1** theme 
8. Open your multiapk installer and select everything you just downloaded
9. Install
10. Now you have Vanced!
