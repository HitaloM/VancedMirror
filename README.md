# Vanced Mirror

Since Vanced has been discontinued, it has become increasingly difficult to find the correct APKs, so here is a complete mirror of the Vanced API.

## How to use

### My Vanced Manager Fork

You can use my Vanced Manager build where this mirror is the default, and was compiled with the latest commits from the dev branch of Vanced Manager.

* [VancedManager](https://github.com/HitaloSama/VancedManager)

### Official Vanced Manager

You can also follow these steps to use this mirror in the official Vanced Manager build. (thanks [@Damaj301damaj-lol](https://github.com/Damaj301damaj-lol) for the tip)

1. Open Vanced Manager and the three dots menu then go to `About`
2. Press the empty space for atleast 10 times
3. It will say that you unlocked developer mode
4. Go to settings and press the new settings icon on the top right
5. Now change the `Channel URL` to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HitaloSama/VancedMirror/main/api/v1`

### Split APKs Installer

You can also opt for some split APKs installer like [SAI](https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI).
